    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Really great appetizer for the summer or anytime. Every time I have served these everyone wants the recipe...and
        they're so easy! Just be sure to refrigerate the cream cheese mixture overnight!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 8-oz package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 .7-oz package dry Italian salad dressing mix</li>
        <li>2 loaves French bread, cut into 1" slices</li>
        <li>2 medium cucumbers, sliced</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried dill weed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, mayonnaise and Italian dressing mix. Refrigerate
            for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the cream cheese blend onto slices of French bread. Top with a cucumber slice, and sprinkle
            with dill. You can make as many or few as you like. the cream cheese mixture keeps for about a week
            in the refrigerator so you can make them over and over again!</li>
